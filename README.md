# Yasmine

Yasmine (Yet Another Station Metadata INformation Editor) is a Python web application to create and edit geophysical station metadata in [FDSN StationXML 1.2](https://docs.fdsn.org/projects/stationxml/en/v1.2/).
Export writes `schemaVersion="1.2"` and validates the file against the vendored schema `backend/yasmine/resources/schemas/stationxml/1.2/fdsn-station-1.2.xsd`.
This is a joint development of IRIS and Résif.
Development and addition of new features is shared and agreed upon between IRIS and Résif.
NRL Online support (2026): ASGSR, Alexey Emanov.

Current version: 4.3.3-beta.

## Known issues

Even if we have performed a lot of tests, Yasmine is currently released in beta version and some bugs and limitations might still be found.

The **AROL** (Atomic Response Objects Library) instrument response library, from Résif, is still being deployed and includes a limited set of instruments.
Use **NRL Offline** or **NRL Online** for the Nominal Response Library.

## Instructions for users

### User Manual

Start with [`docs/user-guide.md`](docs/user-guide.md). Field help in the editor is the English text of the StationXML 1.2 XSD; see [`docs/stationxml-context-help.md`](docs/stationxml-context-help.md). The field checklist is [`docs/stationxml-1.2-coverage.md`](docs/stationxml-1.2-coverage.md).

For offline responses, place a local NRL tree at `data/_media/nrl/content/NRL/` and then enable **NRL Offline (download archive)** in Settings. The repository does not ship an NRL archive.

### NRL Offline

Yasmine can keep a **local copy** of the IRIS Nominal Response Library (full ZIP) for offline use.

1. Go to **Settings** and enable **NRL Offline (download archive)** (stored as `nrl_enabled`)
2. On first start with this option enabled, Yasmine downloads the full NRL ZIP from the [IRIS NRL Web Service](https://service.earthscope.org/irisws/nrl/1/) (no catalog check on initial install)
3. After a successful install, Yasmine checks for updates via `GET /catalog?element=*&format=text&level=configuration&updatedsince=YYYY-MM-DD` — the UTC date of the last successful download
4. If the catalog response contains only the CSV header, the full ZIP is **not** re-downloaded; if one or more configuration rows appear after the header, a new full archive is downloaded and installed atomically
5. Checks run shortly after backend startup and daily at **23:00 UTC** (`NRL_CRON`)

**State and logs** (under `data/`):

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `_media/nrl/content/NRL/` | Installed offline library |
| `_media/nrl/last_successful_download_date.txt` | UTC date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) of last successful install; used as `updatedsince` |
| `_logs/nrl.log` | Sync messages (`Checking NRL updates since …`, skip/download/update/failure) |

Errors during catalog check or download do not remove the existing library. The date file is updated only after a successful install.

In the channel wizard and the channel response editor, **NRL Offline** then asks for a response type: **Datalogger + sensor**, **Integrated**, or **SOH**. Integrated and SOH are read from the `integrated` and `soh` directories of the local archive. A missing directory shows `This response type is not in the downloaded NRL`. **Integrated** fills both channel Sensor and DataLogger. **SOH** fills DataLogger.

Requires internet for download and update checks. For on-demand responses without a local archive, use **NRL Online**.

### NRL Online

Yasmine can use the [EarthScope NRL Web Service](https://service.earthscope.org/irisws/nrl/1/) (NRLv2) to fetch instrument responses on demand, without downloading the full NRL archive.

1. Go to **Settings**, open **NRL Online**, and enable **NRL Online** (stored as `nrlv2_online_enabled`)
2. Optionally set **NRL URL** (stored as `nrlv2_base_url`; default `https://service.earthscope.org/irisws/nrl/1/`)
3. Use **Test** to verify connectivity
4. In the channel wizard, choose **NRL Online**, then **Datalogger + sensor**, **Integrated**, or **SOH**. The library choice stays disabled until the setting is on. **Datalogger + sensor** uses separate Datalogger and Sensor tabs and walks manufacturer, model, and configuration on each. **Integrated** and **SOH** use one tab for that element and the same walk. The channel response editor offers the same three choices. **Integrated** fills both channel Sensor and DataLogger. **SOH** fills DataLogger

Requires internet access. Leave **NRL Online** off when working offline.

As of 20 August 2026 the NRL service is at `service.earthscope.org` (the former `service.iris.edu` host redirects from 24 August 2026). Run `yasmineapp.py syncdb upgrade heads` so existing databases that still store the old default URL are migrated. A custom URL, for example an NRLaggregator, is left unchanged.

### Installation using Docker

1. Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) or [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Run `docker compose build` to compile and build the containers
3. Run `docker compose up` to start
4. Visit <http://localhost:1841>
5. Backend API: <http://localhost:8080/api/> (when using docker compose)
6. Run `docker compose down` to stop

For Python-based installation, see [`backend/README.md`](backend/README.md).

If you are running on an Apple M1 machine, uncomment the lines indicating the target platform in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
